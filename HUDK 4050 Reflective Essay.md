Reflection Essay for HUDK 4050 Educational Data Mining as part of the EDM Portfolio

-Mina Choi 

First of all, I was brought to HUDK 4050 Educational Data Mining course because it was one of the required courses that I had to enroll in order for me to graduate from TC’s Learning Analytics master’s program. Through this course I was hoping and expecting to learn how to code, either through Python or R. Since I had no background in coding or data mining, I felt very nervous before coming to the first class. I was also worried that many of the classmates would be already familiar with programming languages and that I’ll be the only one who does not have past experience in data mining. My personal learning objectives was to become familiar with the uses of big data, learn the basics of programming language, to be able to distinguish whether or not there are faults or biases in the data. 

Cleaning and organizing data, learning different methods of analyses depending on data and what question we want to answer were some of the things that I learned throughout the semester. Engaging with other students in class was also a very valuable experience. Coming with basically no prior knowledge in this area, I struggled a lot and I still believe there are many parts of the course that I need to revisit and review. However, doing group projects with my classmates Honglin, Christine, Robert and Nicholas helped me tremendously academically, socially and psychologically to keep up with the remaining half of the course. As a result, in addition to technical coding skills that I have learned through this course, learning how to approach and answer practical research questions involving data creatively and collaboratively would be one of the key takeaways of this course. There were a few issues that I found quite challenging about using data to resolve questions- knowing what data to include and exclude and knowing which method to use and why. Our team had discussions to resolve this issue, and we often found a solution through them. 

Answering real-world educational problems with data mining methods have increased my interest in the research of the user behaviors and characteristics of online educational services or remote learning. Especially, our creative project made me consider how data analytics could be used in schools and to resolve many complex issues in education. I am not sure how to approach this problem yet, but in the future, I would like to research on the ways to increase the motivations of the adult learners in workplace through online learning. In addition, another area of research that I would be interested in may be discovering the factors that may contribute in increasing the efficiency of remote learning, such as social presence, AR/VR features, etc. Overall, this course let me open my eyes in to working creatively in the world of big data, data analysis, data mining, data management, data literacy, data ethics, and how to tackle real-world educational problems.
